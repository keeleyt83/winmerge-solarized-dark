# winmerge-solarized-dark
Custom colors and a solarized theme for WinMerge

To use, go to Edit > Options and Import this ini file. If you have existing settings you want to save, export your settings first and merge the changes with this ini file. I haven't tried it myself, but it looks like if you kept the "Custom Colors" and DefaultSyntaxColors* defined in this ini file, you should be good to go.
